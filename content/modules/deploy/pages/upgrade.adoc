= Upgrade

In this lesson you'll learn how to install upgrades for Sync Gateway with zero downtime. 

== Requirements

Three instances with the following: 

* Centos 7 
* RAM >= 2GB 


== Getting Started

This lesson contains some scripts to automatically deploy and configure Sync Gateway with Couchbase Server.
Download those scripts on each VM using wget. 

[source,bash]
----

ssh vagrant@192.168.34.11
wget https://cl.ly/1q300A3v3R1D/deploy.zip
sudo yum install -y unzip
unzip deploy.zip
----

Throughout this lesson, you will use different scripts located in the *deploy* folder. 

== Architecture

To follow this lesson you must first have completed the Install lesson and have 2 Sync Gateway nodes up and running.
You have deployed Sync Gateway 1.3 and in this lesson you will deploy Sync Gateway 1.3.1 as a rolling upgrade. 

A rolling upgrade means that the nodes are upgraded one at a time.
While a node is being upgraded it's taken offline by rebalancing the traffic to other nodes.
The diagram below shows this process. 

== Upgrading VM2

First you will need to redirect the traffic to only one Sync Gateway node (VM3). Once the traffic is redirected you will upgrade Sync Gateway on VM2.

=== Try it out

. Log on VM4 (nginx). 
. `cd deploy`
. Run the NGINX script passing only the IP of VM3. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./configure_nginx.sh VM3
----
. Log into VM2 (sync-gateway) 
. Run the Sync Gateway upgrade script on VM2. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./upgrade_sync_gateway.sh
----
. Change back to VM4 
. Run the NGINX script again this time passing the IP of VM2 and VM3. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./configure_nginx.sh VM2 VM3
----
. Monitor the NGINX operations in real-time. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access_log
----
. Change back to VM4. 
. Send a server request to the NGINX port. The response contains the Sync Gateway version. Notice it switches between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 because only one node was upgraded. 
+

[source,bash]
----

curl 'http://localhost:8000'
----

== Upgrading VM3

In this section you will perform the same sequence of operations to upgrade Sync Gateway on VM3.

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./configure_nginx.sh VM2
----
. Log on VM3 (sync-gateway). 
. Run the Sync Gateway upgrade script on VM3. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./upgrade_sync_gateway.sh
----
. Log on VM4 (nginx). 
. Run the NGINX script again this time passing the IP of VM2 and VM3. 
+

[source,bash]
----

sudo ./configure_nginx.sh VM2 VM3
----
. Verify that the Sync Gateway version is now 1.3.1. 
+

[source,bash]
----

curl VM4:8000

{
    "couchdb":"Welcome",
    "vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":1.3},
    "version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/1.3.1(16;f18e833)"
}

== Conclusion

Well done! You've completed this lesson on upgrading the Sync Gateway version.
In the next lesson you will learn how to scale Sync Gatway by adding additional nodes.
